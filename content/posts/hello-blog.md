Hello there!

This is the start of a blog I've wnated to make since... some time ago :)

The idea of this blog, at least for now, is to serve as a braindump of sorts, because I have stuff in my head (mostly tech-related) that I should be putting out there, in the hopes that they can help others solve the problems I've already been through and solved.

So, I started out testing static site generator tools, to see which will be my to-go tool for the job at hand. I started with Hugo; so far, so good, even though I've seen from others that it can get complicated as the site grows, so, we'll see.
